       <h3>About B.V.M. Engineering college</h3>
       Birla Vishvakarma Mahavidyalaya Engineering College was established in 1948
        from donations made by the Birla Education Trust on the behest of Sardar Vallabhbhai
         Patel, the first Home Minister of independent India. The college was inaugurated by 
         Lord Mountbatten, the Governor General of India on 14 June 1948, and rose to prominence 
         under the stewardship of Prof. Junarkar and Prof. K.M. Dholakia. It was one of the 
         first few colleges in India that adopted the progressive credit system of relative 
         grading in India. The college has awarded degrees to over 17,000 graduates, and has 
         its alumni spread across the globe.
